# First-Repository, TensorFlow for Disaster Relief (not yet finished)
NOTE/ UPDATE:
This program has bugs and I have since moved on to other things  (Mostly due to it being done during the school year in which I focussed mainly on school work and my official research projects)... I have since learned a lot more about Linear Algebra/ Machine Learning and its various API's, and may return to this project one day to finish it.


The tensorflow model is function with pre-formatted tensor data
currently formatting my own data to pipe into the model
(READ HERE IF YOU FOR SOME REASON ARE GOOGLE) At line 72 the code is breaking, we have tried the method tf.data.Dataset however no matter which version we try it is not returning the correct class of data (the dataset class) that the documentation says it will. This prevents us from indexing and subsequently iterating our program throught the tensor data. If Google is reading this, I'm sorry, I would just rather blame someone else. And... I could fix this while I work at Google.
